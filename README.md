# Frontend for Stop COVID-19

## Getting Started

Pull the code and install dependencies with yarn (or npm):

```
git clone git@github.com:Stop-COVID-19/frontend.git
cd frontend
yarn
```

The app uses [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/) to build files, which provides out-of-the-box support for handling file types like SASS or Markdown.

You can start the app in development mode with:

```
yarn start
```

Parcel will build to the `./dist` folder.

## Editing content

The main page is built from a markdown file called `main.md`.
